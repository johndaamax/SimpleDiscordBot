# SimpleDiscordBot
A simple discord bot with music playing capabilities. A test project by me to see how bots work in discord


### How to use locally
- Make sure you have node installed. Run ```node -v``` in command prompt to make sure you get a version output.
- After the download, extract and open the folder in VS Code and run ``` npm install ``` in the terminal to install the required dependencies.
- Make sure to **edit** the ```config.json``` file found in the **src** folder to add your own bot's token!!
- Finally, run with ```node index```.
